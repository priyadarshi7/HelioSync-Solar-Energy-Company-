    <h1>Solar Energy Case Studies</h1>

    <div class="case-study">
        <h2>Case Study 1: Solar Power in Rural Electrification</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Example:</span> The Barefoot College in Tilonia, India, implemented solar microgrids to electrify remote villages.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Impact:</span> Empowered women from these communities became solar engineers, bringing sustainable energy solutions to their homes and communities. The impact included improved education, healthcare, and overall quality of life.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="case-study">
        <h2>Case Study 2: Sustainable Business Operations</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Example:</span> Tesla Gigafactory in Nevada, USA, installed one of the world's largest solar rooftop installations.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Impact:</span> The solar panels generate a significant portion of the energy required for the facility's operations, leading to substantial cost savings and a marked reduction in carbon emissions.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="case-study">
        <h2>Case Study 3: Solar-Powered Water Pumping</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Example:</span> In Sub-Saharan Africa, SunCulture provides solar-powered water pumping systems for smallholder farmers.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Impact:</span> These systems enable efficient irrigation, leading to increased crop yields, improved livelihoods, and reduced dependence on traditional, fossil fuel-powered pumps.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="case-study">
        <h2>Case Study 4: Solar Energy for Educational Institutions</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Example:</span> The University of California, Irvine, has committed to sustainability by incorporating solar panels across its campus.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Impact:</span> The installation significantly contributes to the university's energy needs, reducing its carbon footprint and serving as an educational model for students.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="case-study">
        <h2>Case Study 5: Resilience in Disaster-Prone Areas</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Example:</span> After Hurricane Maria in 2017, Tesla, in collaboration with the Puerto Rico government, installed solar+battery systems on the island.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Impact:</span> These systems provide reliable backup power during grid outages, ensuring critical services like hospitals and emergency shelters can function. Showcasing the resilience of solar technology in disaster-prone areas.
