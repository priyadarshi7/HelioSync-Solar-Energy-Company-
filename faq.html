    <h1>Solar Energy FAQs</h1>

    <div class="faq">
        <h2><span class="faq-number">1</span> What is solar energy?</h2>
        <p>Solar energy is the radiant energy emitted by the sun, harnessed through various technologies like solar panels to generate electricity or provide heat.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h2><span class="faq-number">2</span> How do solar panels work?</h2>
        <p>Solar panels contain photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight into electricity. When sunlight hits these cells, electrons are released, creating a flow of electricity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h2><span class="faq-number">3</span> What are the benefits of using solar energy?</h2>
        <p>Solar energy is clean, renewable, and reduces dependence on non-renewable resources. It lowers electricity bills, reduces carbon footprint, and contributes to a sustainable future.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h2><span class="faq-number">4</span> How much space do I need for solar panels on my roof?</h2>
        <p>The space required depends on factors like panel efficiency, local sunlight conditions, and energy needs. A solar installer can assess your property and provide specific recommendations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h2><span class="faq-number">5</span> What is net metering?</h2>
        <p>Net metering is a billing arrangement where excess electricity produced by your solar system is fed back into the grid, and you receive credits for it. It's a way to offset your electricity costs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h2><span class="faq-number">6</span> Are solar panels suitable for my location?</h2>
        <p>Solar panels can be installed in various locations, but ideal conditions include ample sunlight exposure and minimal shading. A site assessment by a professional installer can determine suitability.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h2><span class="faq-number">7</span> How long do solar panels last?</h2>
        <p>Solar panels typically have a lifespan of 25-30 years or more. Their performance may degrade slightly over time, but regular maintenance can extend their efficiency.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h2><span class="faq-number">8</span> Can I use solar energy during a power outage?</h2>
        <p>If you have a solar-plus-storage system (solar panels with batteries), you can use stored energy during a power outage. Standard grid-tied systems may automatically shut down for safety reasons during an outage.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h2><span class="faq-number">9</span> What incentives are available for installing solar panels?</h2>
        <p>Incentives vary by location, but common ones include federal tax credits, state incentives, and local rebates. Check with local authorities or a solar professional for available incentives.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h2><span class="faq-number">10</span> How much does a solar panel system cost?</h2>
        <p>Costs depend on factors like system size, location, and installation complexity. While initial costs may seem high, consider long-term savings on electricity bills and available incentives.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h2><span class="faq-number">11</span> Can I install solar panels myself?</h2>
        <p>While DIY solar kits exist, professional installation is recommended to ensure safety, compliance with regulations, and optimal system performance.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h2><span class="faq-number">12</span> Do solar panels require maintenance?</h2>
        <p>Solar panels are low-maintenance, requiring occasional cleaning and inspections. Professional maintenance services are available for more thorough checks.</p>
